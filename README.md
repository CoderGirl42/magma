Magma MUD - An old-school MUD codebase derived from DIKU, Merc, Envy, and
UltraEnvy that runs on Windows and Linux.

It is written in C and runs on Windows or Linux.  Check the files in /doc for
the various licenses that apply (there are a bunch -- this has inherited from
a long branch of the DIKU MUD family tree).

Documentation is in the /doc directory. Start with README.TXT and go from there.

Source code is in the /src directory. To build on a standard Linux system, run
"make std". To build on Windows, open MagmaMUD.sln with Visual Studio and build.

Magma has been tested with both gcc and clang on Linux.

This codebase was used as the base for Basternae II: Phoenix Rising MUD.
There is a Basternae 3 MUD currently running, but it does not use this code,
but rather a new codebase written using C# .NET.

For Basternae 3, please visit http://basternae.org

## Development Status

Magma is not currently under active development, but I do make changes to it from
time to time to ensure that it can be built on a modern system.

I am willing to accept pull requests if you have improvements to contribute.
