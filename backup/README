Veygoth's Magma MUD version 2.00

=== The player directory

This file gives a brief description of the contents in the player directory

Player files are ASCII text files organized in separate directories.
The average player file is 10K long.  You may compress the playerfiles
using 'gzip -9 -r *' in the player directory periodically.  The server
will uncompress as needed and leave them untouched afterwards until
you compress them manually again.

---
Player files from UltraEnvy will most likely be incompatible with this
release in some way or another, but they do not vary greatly, so with a
little effort you should able to use them if you want -- Veygoth
