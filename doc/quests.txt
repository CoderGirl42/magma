=== QUESTS

With the added support for quests, there are a few things you should
understand about quests.

1)	The only safe way to write a quest is with Tavril's DikuEdit.
2)	Never write a quest by hand.  It's a pain in the butt to get right.
3)	The quest loading procedure is picky.  Don't change the order of
	things in a quest section.

Quests consist of two main parts - the conversations that a mob can have
with a player, which can be part of a quest or can simply be used to give
the mobs another level of interactivity, and the quest item data, which
accepts items from a player and rewards them once they have given the mob
the items needed to complete a quest.

*** More information after I get quests fully implemented ***

=== QUEST DATA FORMAT

Here is an example of a quest section in an area file:
#QUESTS
#716
M
ring band lost hi hello silver wedding wife lost help~
I can't find my ring! I must get it back or my wife will think I don't love
her anymore.  please help me! wait wait! I remember this skinny little fella
bumping into me, he must have stolen it!  Thief!  Thief!  We must catch
him!
~
Q
Oh thank you so very much! here take this amulet, its all I have of any
value.
~
R I 721
G I 720
D
I must be off.  I bid you farewell and wish you the best of luck in your
adventures!
~
S
#0
#$
[End of example]

First off is the section header that identifies this as quest data.  This
is simply #QUESTS and is used just as you would use a #MOBILES or an
#OBJECTS section header in an area file.

Second is the vnum of the mob which the quest is associated with.

After the vnum are various sections signified by various letters:

M	Conversational data:  Keywords and an associated responses
Q	Beginning of Quest section:  Each Q found under a vnum
        begins another quest associated with that mobile.  Under the Q
        is the message given when one completes the quest.
R       Receive item data:
G       Give item data:
D       Disappearance message (optional): If mob disappears when the
        quest is completed, this is the message that is given.  If a mob
        does not disappear, there will be no D section.

So in this example, when this mob is greeted they will fret about their
missing wedding ring, thus giving the player a clue that this is a quest.
When they give the ring (Item #72?) to the mobile, they will thank the
player and hand them item #72? and hurry off.
