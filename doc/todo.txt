Magma MUD 3.04

https://github.com/Xangis/magma

To do list for future versions of Magma:

1) Make the number and types of character classes in the MUD easier to configure.

2) Improve the map generator to make it more versatile.

3) Improve the event system.

4) Improve the documentation.  Document every function in the MUD.  Easier said
than done, of course.
