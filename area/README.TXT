MagmaMud Release 3.04
Monday, March 24th, 2008

In version 3.03 of Magma we added support for most, but not all, Envy 2.2
areas.  So far we have only verified that 62 of the original 63 Envy zones
are able to load.  We do convert Envy values/flags to Magma values, but areas
have not been tested thoroughly, so don't be surprised if you see strange
values on mobs, objects, or rooms.  Any strangeness should be reported via an
issue on the project page on Github: https://github.com/Xangis/magma

The following areas were changed in order to work with Magma 3.03:

smurf.are:   Vnums were changed because they overlapped with the required limbo.are.
ocean.are:   Vnums were changed because they overlapped with the required limbo.are.
plains.are:  Vnums were changed because they overlapped with the required limbo.are.
ofcol.are:   Vnums pointing to changed areas were updated.
haon.are:    Vnums pointing to changed areas were updated.
shaolin.are: Vnums pointing to changed areas were updated.

The following areas will not load in Magma 3.04:

gods.are

They are included in this package in case you wish to add support for them.

All other Envy areas included in this distribution should be unchanged from Envy version
2.2.
