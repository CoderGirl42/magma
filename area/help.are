#HELPS

-1 INDEX~
The index of commands is broken down into numerous sub-sections.  These are:

Combat         Miscellaneous            Character Info
Classes        Races                    Skills
Economy        Magic                    Inventory
Communiction   Party                    Movement
Guilds         Administration*

* = Administrators only

You can get more information on any of these topics by typing:
'help <section name>'.  For example, 'help movement' would bring up
a list of all the commands related to movement.  From there, you can
type 'help <command name>' for any command listed and get detailed
descriptions of the command.

-1 MAP~

From the journals of Lord Gorinae, the Planeswalker...

The overlands seem to be made of two distinct areas, which are
further broken up by oceans.

The first area ("help map1") is more mountainous in nature, while
the other is semi-tropical ("help map2").

I have made no attempt to map the complicated Underdark, the vast
cavernous passages that form a labyrinth under the surface.  The
Underdark is the realm of evil creatures that hate the light
and all who dwell in it.  I feel that such an exploration must
wait until a later date when I can put together a larger and
more powerful expeditionary force.

In addition, there's the entirely different matter of the different
planes of existence.  I cover these in another section of my
journal ("help plane").

-1 NEWBIE~

Welcome to Magma.  If you are an experienced player of Duris, Basternae,
Basternae II, Toril, or similar muds, you can probably skip over this greeting
since most of the commands are similar to what you are used to.

If this is your first time on this mud, we'd like you to spend a moment or
two reading this so you become accustomed to our game.

First we'll start with a warning: This is a PKILL mud.  You can and will be
attacked by other players.  The objective of this game is to kill those on
the other side of the racewars, but there are those on your own side who
will prey on you if you are weaker than them.  Races on the evil side of the
racewars are especially guilty of this type of play.  Use your wits (and the
"flee" command) to escape and learn the game.  

Secondly, read "HELP STORY".  It will give you some background information
on the theme of this MUD.

Your character will start as a level one of whatever class you chose in a
hometown assigned to your race type.  Look over your starting equipment using
the "equipment" and "inventory" commands.  Explore your hometown a bit,
get used to the combat and spell system, and feel free to "petition" any
questions you might have.

"HELP INDEX" will provide you a jumping grounds to various other topics of
interest.  Magma is a complex mud, but once you get used to our style you'll
see that playing here can be a very rewarding experience.

Thanks and have fun,
The Magma Administrative Staff

-1 CLASSES~

A class is a profession or chosen field of study.  Classes dictate what
skills you have, what spells you may learn, and how you fight or act.
Not all classes are available to each race, due to physical or mental
deficiencies.

You can find a chart detailing the classes available to each race by 
typing "help classlist".

The following is a list of the classes that can be chosen by a player
during the character generation process.  More information about each
class can be obtained by typing in "help <class name>".

Warrior        Ranger         Paladin        Anti-Paladin
Thief          Assassin       Cleric         Druid
Shaman         Sorcerer       Elementalist   Enchanter
Mercenary      Psionicist

Berserker*     Mystic*        Warlock*       Chronomancer*

-1 SKILLS~
Each class is granted certain skills, which represent areas in which
a new character has received some basic amount of training.  As a
character uses a skill and goes up in levels, he becomes better at these
skills.  The command "skills" will list all the skills you currently
possess and what level you have them at.  Some skills will only be
available once you reach a certain level.

on Magma, this rules section is rather lengthy and boring.  It has
been broken down into numerous sub-topics to make finding a certain rule
easier.

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE RULES.  IGNORANCE OF A RULE
IS NO EXCUSE FOR BREAKING A RULE.

~

0 'RULES NAMES' NAMES NAME~

Magma is not necessarily a role-playing mud, but we do have strict
standards on names of the players.  We will not accept any of the
following:

Type                                           Example
Foul language                                  No example should be needed
"Real" names                                   Brian, Casey, Leon
Real words, compound words, or slang terms     Dagger, Windwalker
Names of characters from books, movies, etc.   Gandalf, Belgarion, Drizzt
Variations using intentional spelling errors,  Whysper, Blayde
backwards spellings, hooked on phonics
Historical figures                             Arthur, Patton
Random garbage                                 Diouhljl, Xxxxxx
Obvious storage character names                Skistore
Insulting or demeaning names                   Skisucks, Bitemeski
Names of gods or dieties                       Thor, Hermes

All of the above rules apply to both English and non-English languages.

Basically, try to make up a fantasy name that you aren't "stealing"
from another source.

If we catch you with an illegal name, we'll usually ask you to
petition a new name.  We'll rename you and you won't have to delete
or re-roll.  However, certain names will get you termed immediately
(those using foul language or insults).  If you're really stupid
about it, we'll have no qualms about sitebanning you.

If you feel your name is borderline, just petition and we'll be more
than happy to made a judgement call on it.
~

0 'RULES GENERAL'~

1.  DON'T DO ANYTHING THE OVERLORDS WILL CONSIDER CHEESY.  This rule
    should cover all the miscellaneous situations that aren't covered
    specifically in the rules.  Even if we don't state something is
    illegal in the rules, doesn't mean it's not.  If the gods feel you
    are doing some abusive that's not in the spirit of the game, you
    will be punished.
2.  Players shoud settle their own disputes.  Talking to a god should
    be a last resort.  Use the petition channel if you need to consult
    with a god, but try to deal with matters yourself first.
3.  Hacking or stealing the password of other people's characters is
    not allowed.
4.  Trading or giving away characters is not allowed.  The person that
    originally created the character must play it at all times.  The
    only exception to this rule is shared storage characters, which is
    discussed in HELP RULES MULTI.
5.  You may only have a single guilded character at any time.
~

0 'RULES EQUIPMENT'~

READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY: Your primary character must wear his
best gear at all times. This means you have to wear your best stuff
for raids, zones, and scouting.

Secondary characters must also use the best equipment available to
them that is NOT in use by the primary character.  This also includes
using the secondaries for raiding, zoning, and scouting of any kind.

If you're unsure about which character is primary and which are
secondaries, don't risk it.  Always move gear between the character
you are currently using.  If the admin's think what you're doing is
cheesy, you'll be termed.

In addition, you must do your absolute best to equip your characters
before raiding.  If you have equipment on your storage character, use
it.  If the guild storage chest contains stuff, take it.  If you have
money (either your own or belonging to the guild), you must take it
and make every effort to purchase the best equipment you can.  Do not
decline equipment offered to you by friends simply because you want to
raid and don't want to risk losing it.

You may NEVER raid or scout naked or with newbie/minor created equipment,
even if you have nothing on storage.  You must re-equip before raiding,
or scouting.

The only exception to the "best equipment" rules is for corpse retrieval
_immediately_ after a death.  If you die, you may attempt to go back to
your corpse and retrieve ONLY YOUR EQUIPMENT.  You may not try to get
equipment from the corpses of other members of your party.  _Immediately_
means three minutes.  If you can't get to your corpse in three minutes
or less, don't go out until you have fully equipped again.

Even this exception has an exception, however.  In a racewars situation,
you cannot keep going out to loot.  You can go out ONE TIME after you
die to attempt to get your corpse.  After that, you must re-equip
fully before attempting to get your corpse.

Lets give an example to show what I mean:

An evil guild and a goodie guild fight near the goodie guild's hall.  The
evils win, and are in the process of looting equipment from the corpses.
One goodie who died, lets call him Toom, runs back out to try and loot
his corpse.  He dies again.  He may not perform any more CR actions
until he is fully re-equipped.  His other guild members may not attempt
to loot his corpse until they are fully equipped (but they may each make
one attempt to loot their own corpses).
~

0 'RULES ARTIFACTS'~

Artifacts must be on "primary" characters.  Since the issue of "primary"
characters can get confusing, use your best judgement and/or ask the
administrators.  If you have a character in a guild, that character is
your primary, regardless of playtimes.

A single character can only have one artifact.

Artifacts must always be equipped or carried.  This means that you
can't give an artifact to someone to 'protect' it, you shouldn't 
drop and hide it to avoid losing it, etc.  About to get killed by
a mob that might turn you into a dracolich and nuke all of your
equipment? Bummer, you HAVE to keep that artifact with you.  The
only way you should pass off an artifact that you are actively 
using is when it is pried from your dead fingers.  If you acquire 
an artifact that you are unable to use, yes, you an give it away
to someone that can, but once you do, it is theirs to keep or
lose.

Even if you can't use an artifact (like goodies getting a shaman 
artifact), it must be carried so that the other side has a chance
to get it back.

If the admin's feel the player holding an artifact isn't "active"
enough, the artifact will be taken and put back to its original location.

Artifacts are on a "random load" timer and do not load up every boot
in zones.  This means that if an artifact is reset and put back in
its home, it will not be there every boot.
    
If you are unsure if a piece of equipment is considered an artifact,
ask.  For the most part any unique piece of equipment, including
stuff from quests, is considered an artifact, even if it's not
completely overpowering.
~

0 'RULES BUGS'~

1.  Report all bugs you find using the 'bug' command.  If it's an
    emergency, use the 'petition' command to inform the gods.
2.  Once you've reported the bug, do not continue to use it.
3.  If you find a bug, don't report it, and continue to use it, you
    will be punished.
4.  Bugs consist of errors in the code and errors in zones, such as
    the infamous "money bugs" that crop up.
~

0 'RULES MULTI' 'RULES MULTI-PLAYING'~

Multi-playing is a complex and confusing part of the game, and one that
you should make every effort to understand.  Failure to follow the
policies set in these rules will result in HARSH punishment.  Ignorance is
not an excuse.

1.  You may NOT have more than one character on at ANY time.  THIS
    INCLUDES LINK-DEAD CHARACTERS.  You must rent or camp out your other
    character BEFORE you bring on a new one.  The ONLY exception is as
    follows:  you may have two characters on in the same room (in an inn
    or other rentable location) for the purpose of exchanging or storing
    equipment.

2.  You may NOT bring on a character belonging to the opposite side of the
    racewars for ONE HOUR after logging off the first character.  No
    exceptions to this rule will be allowed.

   Example: Madra is a Gnome and gets bored of playing for a while.  She
   decides to log on a newbie Drow Elf.  Ooops, big mistake on her part,
   since she's now broken rule number two and we kindly admins nuke both
   chars.

3.  You may NOT bring on another character for the purpose of using it
    to act as a "translator" to get around the language barrier.

4.  You may NOT bring on another character in order to retrieve
    equipment for a character that has died, REGARDLESS of whether that
    other character's corpse has decomposed or not.  This includes, but is
    not limited to, creating "newbies" to retrieve corpses or eq
    REGARDLESS of who's corpse is being retrieved.

5.  You may NOT use a second character to cast spells on another. This
    rule also applies to logging another character on as a "target" for a 
    spell.
    
6.  You CANNOT share characters.  You cannot give a character away. You
    cannot loan characters out for any reason. If we catch you, we will
    delete every character you have.  To make sure you understand: You
    can NOT loan or trade characters.  

   Example1: Tony is a player with a high level shaman and secondary high
   level warrior.  He wants to go out and raid with his shaman, but wants
   a basher along with him.  He asks a friend of his to play his warrior
   for a while so they can group and go kill people.  Later on, Tony logs
   out his shaman and starts playing the warrior himself.  Oooops, big
   mistake on his part, because Tony just broke rule number eight and now
   both characters will be terminated.

    The only exception to this is shared storage characters, which may
    never leave the inn room they are rented in.  A maximum of three people
    may share a storage character.

7.  You may not trade or give characters to other people.  Once a player
    is created, the same person must play that character until he is
    deleted.  You may not trade one character for another, nor may you
    give a character away for free or for reimbursement of any kind.

8.  You may NOT use a second character with the sole purpose being to
    camp near an equipment repop site or to act as a portal/moonwell
    target for a zone. Despite the importance of equipment, hoarding
    equipment by this means is deplorable, dishonorable, and ILLEGAL.
    Using characters as a target for racewars in this fashion is also
    illegal.

7.  You may NOT log on another character to take revenge for another
    of your character's that was just killed, looted, stolen from, hit
    with a spell, or had any other ill effect placed on him by another
    character FOR TWO HOURS after the incident occurred.
    
9.  You may NEVER scout with low level characters or newbies, just to
    avoid risking a primary or high level secondary character.  Using
    newbies to scout for targets for raids or to do corpse retrieval/
    looting is extremely cheesy and will result in angry admins.

10. You cannot transfer equipment from a character on one side of the
    racewars to another.  This means if you have a stacked goodie char and
    want to start playing an evil character, you must get all new stuff
    with the evil.  You cannot have other people transfer the gear for
    you, and you most certainly cannot have someone kill and loot your
    first character and give it to the second.
~

0 'RULES PUNISHMENT'~

The administrative staff for Magma can deal with the players any
way they want.  We don't have to give you a warning or a second chance
(but we usually do).  

We do not have set policies for punishment.  It's up to each individual
god to deal with things how he sees fit.

We can and will siteban people who we don't want playing on Magma.
If a siteban "hurts" innocent bystanders because they can no longer
connect to Magma, we're sorry, but that happens.  Sitebanning is
our final option and we don't like doing it.
~

0 'RULES DISCLAIMER'~

While the administrators of Magma attempt to maintain an environment
suitable for gaming, we cannot control all the actions of our players.
We will do our best to provide for the entertainment of the majority of
our players.  Spamming or harrassment will not be tolerated on this mud,
but the admins are not responsible if it does.

We reserve the right to run this mud how we think is best.  If a player
doesn't approve of our methods, he or she is welcome to leave and find
another mud.  We reserve the right to be jerks or worse.  We reserve the
right to change things without telling a single person.  We reserve the
right to pretty much do whatever we want, actually.

We also aren't responsible for player stupidity.  If you give out your
password to someone, or download a virus from another player who tells
you about this "really cool game" he has, or do anything else on the mud
that affects your real-life, the admins cannot be blamed.

By playing on this mud, you agree to these terms.

~

0 'RULES REIMBURSEMENT' 'REIMBURSEMENT'~

We do not give out reimbursements, unless there is a wide-spread
corruption in our player database.  

If you lose an item to a mistake or bug, you will not be given a
replacement.  This includes situations like lost or stolen items,
decayed corpses, losses caused by crashes or reboots, hacked accounts,
changes to the game, or guild hall chest or player ship malfunctions.
~

0 'RULES IMMORTALS'~

The immortals of Magma put a lot of time and effort into the game
and should be treated with respect.  We don't care if you like us, but
we won't tolerate extreme insults or slander.

The immortals of Magma can and do play mortal characters, but make
every effort to keep mortal and immortal affairs seperate.  The
administrators of Magma do not show favortism to one racewars side
or another.  We make changes to the game based on game balance issues,
not our mortal characters, guilds, or personal interests.
~

0 'RULES RACEWARS'~

1.  Player killing is legal and expected.  The objective of the game is
    to kill players on the opposite side of the racewars, but same side
    pkilling is allowed.
2.  Player killing in goodie hometowns is affected by the JUSTICE code.
    Read help justice for more information.
3.  If you have multiple characters, you may not use one of the characters
    to gain revenge for the death, looting, or any other ill effects that
    happen to your other character until a period of two hours has passed.
4.  If you involved in any racewars situation (attacking or scouting)
    you may not log on another character to take part in any racewars
    activity for two hours.

    To give you an example, lets say your level 15 goblin warrior runs
    into some goodies in a zone.  Regardless of whether your warrior
    was attacked or not, as long as he or a group member spotted the
    goodies in any fashion, you cannot log in another character for
    two hours to do any type of raiding, counter-raiding, and so on.

~

-1 'ANTI-PALADIN' ANTI 'ANTI PALADIN'~
Fighter sub-class

Anti-paladins are the anti-thesis of paladins.  They serve the evil gods and
seek to bring nothing but pain and suffering to the world.  

Anti-paladins, like paladins, get limited spellcasting abilities granted by
their gods.  These abilities increase as their level increases, showing the
anti-paladin to be gaining favor with his chosen diety.  

Anti-paladins have the innate ability to detect good, and have some limited
protection from good.  Anti-paladins are superb fighters when wielding
two-handed weapons and have trained so that they can bash effectively when
not using a shield.  Anti-paladins are granted the powers of
'vampiric touch', their dark gods granting the ability to heal themselves as
they do damage to others.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Wisdom

Races: Orc, Githyanki, Githyzerai

Equipment: Anti-Paladins can use almost all weapons and armor.  They are
           limited in the types of magical items such as wands, staves, or
           scrolls.

Innate Abilities: Detect Good, Summon Mount (must be level 10),
                  Vampiric Touch

Duration:       24 Hours

against all melee attacks, but not attacks that are magical in nature.

See also: ARMOR CLASS
~

0 'ARMOR CLASS'~
Armor class, sometimes abbreviated as AC, is a value that represents how
protected a character is.  Armor class is based on a scale from +100 to
-100, with +100 being the worst possible armor (naked), while -100 is the
best.

Equipment can raise and lower your armor class.  The lower your AC, the
harder it is to hit you.  The help entry for THAC0 (to-hit armor class
zero) contains more information on the combat system and how armor class
affects it.

See also: THAC0
~

0 ARTIFACTS~

Artifacts are weapons or items of immense power.  They are very hard to
obtain and there is only one of the artifacts in the game....EVER.

Artifacts must be on "primary" characters.  Since the issue of "primary"
characters can get confusing, use your best judgement and/or ask the
administrators.  If you have a character in a guild, that character is
your primary, regardless of playtimes.

A single character can only have one artifact.

Artifacts must always be equipped or carried.  This means that you
can't give an artifact to someone to 'protect' it, you shouldn't 
drop and hide it to avoid losing it, etc.  About to get killed by
a mob that might turn you into a dracolich and nuke all of your
equipment? Bummer, you HAVE to keep that artifact with you.  The
only way you should pass off an artifact that you are actively 
using is when it is pried from your dead fingers.  If you acquire 
an artifact that you are unable to use, yes, you an give it away
to someone that can, but once you do, it is theirs to keep or
lose.

Even if you can't use an artifact (like goodies getting a shaman 
artifact), it must be carried so that the other side has a chance
to get it back.

If the admin's feel the player holding an artifact isn't "active"
enough, the artifact will be taken and put back to its original location.

Artifacts are on a "random load" timer and do not load up every boot
in zones.  This means that if an artifact is reset and put back in
its home, it will not be there every boot.
    
If you are unsure if a piece of equipment is considered an artifact,
ask.  For the most part any unique piece of equipment, including
stuff from quests, is considered an artifact, even if it's not
completely overpowering.

-1 ASSASSIN~
Rogue sub-class

Assassins are trained killers, men and women who cloak themselves in dark and
shadows in order to slay their chosen victims.  Assassins are the masters of
the "instant kill", surprising a foe and murdering it in a single strike.
Assassins are experts in the arts of backstabbing, placing a dagger or two
right in the vital areas of a target and causing horrendous damage.  Most
assassins work alone, although some work in teams in order to bring down
difficult opponents.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility

Races: Human, Half-Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Githyzerai, Orc, Drow Elf, Githyanki,
       Rakshasa

Equipment: Assassins are rogues, and can use most weapons.  Their choice of
           armor is more limited, however, since heavy armor makes sneaking
           in shadows impossible.

Innate Abilities: None

56 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

AT executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

AT works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).  Thus, AT will not work to private locations.
~

0 ATTRIBUTES~
Syntax: attributes

ATTRIBUTES will give you a list of information about your character,
including level, race, class, age, height, weight, and your attribute
scores.

There are eight primary attributes:
     Strength       Constitution        Agility        Dexterity
     Intelligence   Wisdom              Charisma       Luck

Each of these attributes can range from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst
and 100 the best.  However, please note that the 0 to 100 scale is based
on the race of the character.  A score of 100 strength for an ogre is not
the same as 100 strength for a gnome.  The ogre is still much more powerful.
The score of 100 indicates that he is the best he can be for his race,
while the gnome's score of 100 indicates that he is as strong as possible for
a gnome.

0 AUTO CONFIG~
Syntax: auto
Syntax: config
Syntax: config +<option>

AUTO shows the status of some of your character behavior options.

The CONFIG command configures some of your character behavior.  With no
options, CONFIG shows you your current settings (identical to the AUTO

~

0 BACKSTAB BS~
Applied skill

Syntax:     backstab <target>
Aggressive: yes

A backstab is an attempt to sneak up on a victim and place a weapon in a
critical spot in his back, doing more damage than a normal attack.  The
success of the backstab is dependant on the skill of the person attempting
to stab the target.

Only piercing weapons can be used to backstab.  Assassins and rogues with
good enough skills in backstabbing and dual wielding weapons can
double-backstab if they are wielding two piercing weapons.

You cannot backstab a target while in combat.  Backstabbing is an aggressive
action.

Bandage can be used by any player to try help repair an incapacitated player
or mob.  The command must have a target and it can be stacked.  A typical

further hurt the target.  Once the targets hit points returns to above zero,
bandage will no longer help them.

-1 BARBARIAN BARBARIANS~

Barbarians are closely related to humans, but are larger, sturdier,
and possess more stamina than their human cousins.  Many barbarians
are roving nomads, content to roam the plains of the north.  Others
have settled into more permanent towns and cities, forming a society
based on Clans.  

Most barbarians are ill-tempered.  Humans tend think of the barbarians as
stupid and dull, but this is certainly not the case for all barbarians.
Many are outstanding artisans, while others are extremely cunning warriors.

Class list: Warrior, Shaman, Mercenary

Stats:  Barbarains are generally stronger and hardier than humans,
        but tend to trail them in all other areas.

        STR: Excellent          INT: Bad

-1 BARD~
Rogue sub-class

Bard are a unique clss, mixing a blend of rogue skills with magical abilities
granted by their music.  Bards are traveling entertainers, telling tales and
singing songs of lore and heroism.

Bards use instruments and song to create magical effects.  The power of their
music may not be as powerful as a mage's magic, but many of the bard's
"spells" are unique to his class and very beneficial to the bard's entire
party.  Bards are truly suited for large groups.

Not even the greatest of bards can sing indefinitely, however, and when the
throat of a bard gets sore, he must rest to regain his strength.  This is
represented by a bard's "mana", which regenerates over time.  Each song a
bard plays takes a certain amount of mana.  Certain songs can be continuously
sung, draining mana over a period of time.

Important Attributes: Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution

Races: 

Equipment: 

Equipment: Bards are rogues, and can use most weapons.  Their choice of
           armor is more limited, however, since heavy armor makes
           playing instruments difficult.

Innate Abilities: None

~

0 BASH~
Applied skill
     
Syntax:     bash <target>
Aggressive: yes

Bashing is a skill used to knock another player or creature down.  It is most
effective when the person trying to bash is wearing a shield.  Bashing is
a very level dependant skill.  For example:  A level 50 player will hit bash
a lot more frequently than a level 1 player.  Missing a bash will send you
toppling to the ground where you will take extra damage.

Size does matter!  A basher can only bash opponents of the same, one size, or
two sizes smaller.

Note: Paladins and Anti-Paladins can bash effectively without a shield.

Spell

Syntax:         cast 'battle ecstasy'
Area of Effect: Self

This spell heals the anti-paladin as his group members attack and do
damage to the enemy.  A small percentage of the damage that his party
members do is given to the anti-paladin as health.  This spell will

Area of Effect: Single target, Touch
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster
Type of spell:  Animal

This spell increases the target's strength, while slightly decreasing
the target's dexterity.  Because of the spell's detrimental effects,
the target will save against it.  Thus, if the target wants to be the
recipient (and lose any chance of a successful sv_spell roll), he should
"consent" to the caster.

See also:  MOUSESTRENGTH, ELEPHANTSTRENGTH, CONSENT
~

0 BERSERK~
Applied Skill

Syntax:     berserk
Aggressive: no

Berserk represents a massive adrenaline rush and an almost mindless rage
and need to kill.  Berserking causes a person to ignore his personal safety
and that of his friends in his lust for blood.

When berserked, the strength and constitution of the player go up, but
dexterity, agility, intelligence, and wisdom all drop.  The player will do
more damage and have more health, but will be easier to hit as well.  When
the effect wears off, the player will return to his normal stats.  If the
drop in hit points because of the player's constitution takes his total to
less than 0, he will die.

You cannot cast spells, flee, or perform many other actions while berserked.
While berserk, you may attack friends because of the blinding rage you are
engulfed in.

You can attempt to start/stop a berserk rage by typing 'berserk'.  Your level
and skill will determine the success of your attempt.

Duration:       Very short
Type of Spell:  Enchantment

resistance to spells and improve the target's ability to hit his foes.

Blessed objects, particularly weapons, may have special effects when used
against certain creatures.  Other blessed objects may have other beneficial
effects.

     Centaurs
     Ogres
     Trolls
     Minotaurs
     
NOTE: Bodyslam can only be used by Warriors and Mercenaries.

Syntax: bodyslam <target>

Bodyslam is a powerful action used only while a player is not engaged in
battle.  A successful bodyslam will knock its target to the ground and
stun them for a brief period of time.  If you miss a bodyslam you will
fall to the ground in the reclined position and be stunned.  While 
reclined a player will take a great amount of damage.

One cannot bodyslam while engaged.  The action becomes easier with higher
levels.  The size of the target does matter.  One cannot bodyslam any
target that is larger nor will one succeed at bodyslamming a target that
is over two sizes smaller.

0 'BURNING HANDS'~
Spell

Syntax:         cast 'burning hands' <target>          
Area of Effect: Single target, In-Room
Aggressive:     Yes
Cumulative:     N/A
Duration:       Instant

This spell causes the caster's hands to burst into flames, causing the
mage's very touch to cause extreme pain in the target he chooses.
~

0 BUY~
Syntax: buy [quantity] <object> [shopkeeper]

BUY will allow you to try and purchase an item from a shopkeeper.  If no
quantity is given, the mud will assume you would like to buy one item. 
If no shopkeeper is given, the first shopkeeper in the room will be chosen.

BUY, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a player
to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if the command "LIST DAGGER" showed you that a shopkeeper had
five daggers, you could type "BUY 3.DAGGER".

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would
attempt to buy three daggers, not the third dagger.

Prices in shops can be affected by a player's charisma.

0 'CALL LIGHTNING'~

0 CAMP~
Syntax: camp

CAMPing allows you to exit the game while in the wilderness, away from the
friendly confines of an inn.  Camping requires a certain amount of time
before it can be done.  During this time while you are setting up your camp,
you can not leave the room or enter combat.  You will enter the game at the
same spot where you camped.

If you go linkdead while camping, the camping timer will stop.

~

0 CARVE~
Applied Skill
     All classes

Syntax: carve <name of corpse> <body part>

NOTE: Carving requires that you are wielding a dagger.

Carving can be done on other players corpses.  After the player is dead
you can carve many different pieces from the corpse.  To find out what
body parts remain in the corpse type, carve <corpse name>.  To then carve
one of the parts out of the corpse use the syntax listed above.  You can
then even wear some of the body parts.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> [target|object]
Syntax: cast '<spell>' [target|object]

CAST is a command used to call upon the forces of magic to perform some task
for the player.

The spell being cast must be in the caster's memory.  Magic users must
memorize their spells from spellbooks using the MEMORIZE command, while
priests use the PRAY command and do not need spellbooks.

NOTE: A mage has a "virtual spellbook" with them at all times.  This
virtual spellbook only requires that a mage scribe a spell once from
a teacher and he will know it forever.  His proficiency at casting that
spell will go up as his skill with that spell increases.

If the spell name is more than one word, you must enclose it in a single
quote.  For example: cast 'cure light wounds' Ski, where Ski is the target
of the spell.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.

You can also abbreviate spell names.  You must type in a minimum amount of
letters to make the spell "unique", so the mud knows which spell you mean.
For example, cast 'cure' Ski would not work for casting cure light wounds,
because there are multiple cure spells.  Typing cast 'cure l' Ski would,
since the other cure spells do not include the letter l.

Many spells require a target.  That target can be a player or an object.
If a spellcaster is casting a spell on himself, he can simply use "me" or
"self" as the target.  

If a spellcaster is casting an offensive spell while in combat, and the
target is the enemy the spellcaster is fighting, the spell will be
automatically directed at the enemy if no target is given.

CAST allows the use of the #.target format, where # is a number.  This
allows a player to choose a specific target from a group of players, mobs,
or items with the same keywords.

For example, if there were four demons in a room and the spellcaster wanted
to cast a fireball on the third one, he would type:

     cast 'fireball' 3.demon

Make sure you include the period between the number of the target and the
name.  If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, the
spell wouldn't work because it would attempt to cast the spell "3", which
obviously doesn't exist. 

There is help available for each individual spell.  The command "SPELLS"
will give a player a list of all spells he can obtain.  "help <class> spells"
will bring up a list of all the spells available to the desired class.

0 'CAULDRON OF REBIRTH'~
Spell

Syntax:         cast 'cauldron of rebirth' <corpse>
Area of Effect: Single corpse, requires consent
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     N/A
Duration:       Instant
Type of spell:  Necromancy

This spell will restore life to a corpse, negating most of the
experience lost by the death, in the same manner as the "resurrect"
spell.  However, this spell has a greater chance of failure.

The power of this spell takes a toll on both the druid and the target
and both are exhausted by the procedure.

This spell is not without risks.  If the person being resurrected has
low constitution, the strain of being resurrected may be too great, in
which case the spell may fail, and the corpse will be incapable of
being restored to life.  If this spell fails to work on a corpse, the
corpse may not be resurrected by any other means, either.  Basically,
if a target fails a resurrection or cauldron spell, it cannot be ressed
later.

You must have the target's consent before performing a cauldron of
rebirth or the spell will fail.

-1 CENTAUR CENTAURS~ 

Centaurs are a race with human torsos atop the bodies of horses.  Because
of their odd body shapes, they cannot wear some of the equipment that normal
humanoid-shaped races can.  Their strength, however, makes them ideal
warriors, and they can wield much larger weapons than any of the other
surface races.  They prefer to dwell in natural surroudings, shunning the
major cities, and this link with nature has led them to develop a small
talent for druidic practices.  Their somewhat slow-wittedness, however,
makes them somewhat less wise than the rest of the surface world.

Some people shun or hunt centaurs because of their odd physical shape.
Many times centaurs are outcast from the larger cities when they do visit.
This has caused the centaur peoples to become very tribal and close-knit.

Class list: Druid, Warrior, Ranger

Stats:  Centaurs are large and very strong.  They lack the keen mental powers
        of some of the other surface races and they tend to be a little bit
        clumsy because of their bulk.

        STR: Unsurpassed                INT: Very Poor
        DEX: Poor                       WIS: Poor

-1 CLERIC~
Priest sub-class

Clerics are men and women who gain magical powers granted by their gods.
Their deities give them great abilities which they use to further the goals
of their chosen gods and goddesses.

The deity a cleric worships is chosen by his or her race, and sometimes by
the clerics sex as well (in the case of the drow deities).  Each god or
goddess grants their follows with some unique spells and abilities.

Falling out of favor with one's god (usually because of a cleric's alignment
changing) can be very nasty.  Gods do not enjoy priests who turn away from
their religion.

Important Attributes: Wisdom

Races: Human, Grey Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, Orc, Drow Elf,
       Duergar Dwarf, Goblin, Half-Elf, Flind

Equipment: Clerics are priests, and are restricted to using non-edged
           weapons such as clubs, maces, and flails.  Priests can wear
           most types of armor.

Innate Abilities: None

~

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour - Toggles colour mode on/off

&+WThe Book of Magma Ansi Codes&n

First things first.  The main thing to understand when using our version of
ansi color is you can SET things, or CLEAR ALL (back to white on black), but
you cannot just turn off bold, or blink.  This means that once you have used
a color code that involves bold colors or blinking colors, you have to send
a CLEAR ALL signal or else everything after will remain bold or blinking.

There are 4 types of ansi control sequences:

& <N> | <n> -   reset everything, back to 'n'ormal (white on black).  This is also
             done for every newline, to eliminate 'bleed-through' colors.
& + <color> -  set foreground color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BOLD
             (bright/light) bit is also set (and will STAY set until either
             a newline, or &<N> is done).
& - <color> -  set background color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BLINK
             bit will be set (same as for &+ above).
& = <bg><fg> - set both background <bg> and foreground <fg> color, with exactly
             the same restrictions as for setting foreground and background
             colors seperately.

NOTE: There are no spaces in the color sequences.  Spaces are shown above only
      to prevent the parser from interpreting them as real color sequences.

w - &+Wwh&n&+wite&n   l - &+Lblack&n   r - &+Rr&n&+red&n   b - &+Bbl&n&+bue&n
g - &+Ggr&n&+geen&n   y - &+Yye&n&+yllow&n  c - &+Ccy&n&+can  &n m - &+Mma&n&+mgenta&n

0 COMBINE~
Syntax: combine

COMBINE toggles your seeing combined format of identical items in the room.

See CONFIG to find out which toggle is on and which is off.
~

0 COMMANDS~
Syntax: commands

COMMANDS shows you all of the commands (except socials) available to you.

See also: SOCIALS
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object1> [object2]

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory or equipment list.  If both
objects are weapons, it will report the one with the better average damage.
If both objects are armor, it will report the one with the higher armor class.

COMPARE doesn't take into account any special affects on objects, so it can't
be considered an accurate measure of the power of an object.

COMPARE with one object compares an object in your inventory to the object you
are currently wearing or equipping of that same type.  It only compares against
the first item it finds, so if you are wielding two swords, it would only
compare against the first one.
~

0 'COMPLAINT FORM'~

Because of the amount of complaints we have been getting about our game
recently, the staff of Magma has decided to make the job of the
players (which is to complain, of course) at bit easier.  The following
form should speed up the response time of the Magma staff, ensuring
that we are able to give in to every whim of the players in a timely and
efficient manner.

Please bear with us, however, if we still seem a bit slow in changing the
mud code after you submit this form.  The sheer amount of people who know
more than the admins of Magma is simply amazing, and we are constantly
struggling to keep up with the tide of mistakes and errors that we have
made up to this point in time.

Make sure you fill out the complaint form fully.  If you see multiple
options in parenthesis, such as (one/two/three), please only choose one.
If you see ____ lines in front of a list of options, choose as many as you
like, unless the form tells you specifically to do otherwise.

---------

Dear (sirs/admins of Magma/bastards/assholes),

I would like to file a (complaint/complaint/big complaint) about your mud,
Magma.  

I think ____________________________ (insert race/class here) is horribly
underpowered.  I mean, come ON!  They don't even get (triple 
attack/quadruple attack/deathfield/all of the above).  All of the other
(classes/races) are so much better than ________________________ (insert
race/class here) that it's not even fun to play anymore.  At the minimum,
you should give them ___________________ (insert new ability here), and
the following:
     ___ judgement
     ___ major para
     ___ biofeedback
     ___ instant-kill
     ___ dragon breath
     ___ other _______________________

(Goodies/evils) are also so much more powerful than my side of racewars, I
don't see how we can even play.  You gods are so biased for
(goodies/evils)!  Why do (goodies/evils) have _____________________ (insert
race/class/ability) here and we don't?

I have been playing this game since (you opened/Duris/pre-wipe Duris/beta 
Duris) so I know what I'm talking about.  I could run this mud
(10/100/1000/a jillion) times better than you guys.

So, in conclusion, you are the most (moronic/stupid/grossly incompetent)
(buffoons/jerks/spawns of Satan) to ever run a mud.  Maybe you gods should
stop (cheating/lying/performing lewd acts with your sister) and start
running a decent mud for a change.

(Yours truly/Bite me whores/Go to hell and die/Love),
______________________________ (insert your name here)

0 'COMPREHEND LANGUAGES'~
Spell

Syntax:         cast 'comprehend languages' <target>
Area of Effect: Single target, In-Room
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependant on proficiency of caster
Type of Spell:  Enchantment

This spell gives the target the ability to understand all the other
languages that are spoken, but only if they are spoken by their native
race or someone who is perfectly fluent in that language.

For example, if PlayerOne is a troll and PlayerTwo is a goblin, normally
PlayerOne will have problems understanding PlayerTwo (at least until his
skill in that language goes up enough).  If PlayerOne had comprehend
languages cast on him, he could understand PlayerTwo perfectly as long
as PlayerTwo spoke goblin.  If PlayerTwo chose to speak orc, this
spell would have no beneficial effect.

Type of spell:  Summoning

0 'CONJURE GREATER ELEMENTAL'~
Spell

Syntax:         cast 'conjure greater elemental'
Area of Effect: None
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     N/A
Duration:       Dependant on proficiency of caster
Type of Spell:  Summoning

This spell calls upon the magic of one of the primary elemental planes or
one of the lesser demi-elemental planes and conjures forth one of the
elementals that make their home there.  The creature can do simple
functions such as fight and move, but more complex tasks are beyond
the abilities of the summoned beast.

The type of elemental that answers the mage's summons is random, but weighted
towards the caster's focus plane or one of the adjacent ones.  A water
elementalist, for example, would be most likely to get an elemental from the
plane of water.  He is less likely to get one from one of the adjacent
demi-planes.  He is most unlikely to obtain an elemental from the elemental
plane opposite his own focus (fire to water, earth to air), and if he does...
the elemental will most likely attack the caster, recognizing him as an
enemy.

0 CONSENT~
Syntax: consent [character|who]

Certain actions require consent between one player and another to be
performed.  You agree to allow the other player to perform an action on
you by giving them your consent.

An example of actions that require consent are:
     Joining a group
     Having the resurrect spell cast on a corpse

You can only consent one person at a time.  You can change it as often as
you wish.  You do not have to be consented to the group leader to stay in
the group, for example.

You must be able to see the person you want to consent.

Typing CONSENT with no arguments will revoke your consent.

Typing CONSENT WHO will list the people who are consented to you.

See also: GROUP
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <target>

CONSIDER will compare your level and experience with that of the target and
give you a rough estimate of your chances of winning in a fight.

CONSIDER is not accurate for higher level mobs, since it requires a group
of people working together to slay more powerful beasts.

For example, a level 8 player who considers a level 8 mob to find it's the
same level has a good chance of winning.  A level 50 player who considers a
level 50 to find it's the same level has little chance of winning the fight
alone.
~

0 CONSTITUTION~
Attribute

Constitution represents your health and well-being, how fit you are and how
much pain you gain resist.  Constitution is important for all classes, since
it affects how many hit points you gain per level.  

Some stouter races, such as ogres and centaurs, have much higher levels of
constitution than frailer races such as drow elves or grey elves.

attack does can vary.  The amount of damage done isn't given as an exact

damage than one that "scratches".

player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if you had 2 swords and wanted to drop the second one, you
would type:

     drop 2.sword

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the
name.  If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you
would attempt to drop an item with the keyword "2".

-1 DROW 'DROW ELF' DROW ELVES'~

Drow elves, sometimes called dark elves (but never by the drow or anyone
within earshot that wishes to avoid a fight), are an offshoot of the
elven race, kin to the grey elves of the surface.  Because of their evil
nature, the drow were driven out from the homes on the surface and
forced to move into hiding in the bowels of the Underdark.

The drow hate all creatures of the surface and constantly scheme and plot
to slay those who dwell in the sunlight.  Life for a drow in their dark,
gloomy underground cities is hard.  Noble houses and merchant families
strive for power, obtaining it via any possibly means including
assassination, political backstabbing, and open warfare.

Class list: Warrior, Hunter, Sorcerer, Assassin, Cleric,
            Fire Elementalist

Stats:  Drow tend to be weaker and frailer than humans, but are better
        in most other areas. Drow are somewhat resistant to magical
        attacks.

-1 DRUID~
Priest sub-class

Druids are priests who gain their powers from nature itself.  They usually
live in the woods and forests and live to protect the trees and wildlife
contained within.  Attempting to harm a druid's forest in any way will bring
the priest's wrath.  Druids gain spells from the deities of the forests and
nature, and have some incredible powers at their disposal.  Many of these
spells must be cast in the outdoors, while others are just less effective
while inside.

In addition to normal spells, druids have special rituals.  These act as
spells, except they require multiple druids working together in a complex
weaving of nature's magical forces.  Many of these rituals are very
powerful and require longer periods of time to cast.

Important Attributes: Wisdom

Races: Human, Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Centaur

Equipment: Druids are priests, and are restricted to using non-edged weapons 
           such as clubs, maces, and flails.  Priests can wear most types of 
           armor.

Innate Abilities: Shapeshift

-1 DUERGAR 'DUERGAR DWARF' DUERGARS~

Duergar, or gray dwarves, are an evil and twisted race, living in the lowest
depths of the Underdark.  Cunning and manipulative, it is said that only the
duergar can match the cruelty and depravity of the drow elves.  They hate all
other races, but have some grudging relations with a few of the other races
of the Underdark.

Duergar, like the mountain dwarves they despise, are inordinately sturdy and
strong.  They have medium to dark gray skin and hair and prefer to wear drab
clothing to blend into their environment.  Duergar have the unique ability to
cloak themselves in darkness, melding into the shadows to become invisible.
This ability is only usable in the caverns of the Underdark.

Class list: Warrior, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary, Cleric

Stats:  Duergar are stronger and hardier than humans, and somewhat
        more dextrous, but tend to be less intelligent and agile.

-1 DWARF 'MOUNTAIN DWARF'~

Mountain dwarves are a noble race with a history stretching back through the
ages.  Living in great fortresses of stone and rock, the mountain dwarves
are miners by nature, delving deep into the mighty mountain ranges to
carve out their homes.

Dwarves are a close-knit society, preferring the company of their own kind
to that of outsiders.  Mountain dwarves are quite strong, sturdy, and
stubborn to a fault.  They can live to be hundreds of years old and it is
said that each year they live this hard and unyielding nature increases.

Class list: Warrior, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary, Cleric

~

-1 ELEMENTALIST~
Magic-User sub-class

Elementalists focus on one of the major elements (air, fire, water, earth)
and learn to harness the power of that element for use in spellcasting.
Elementalists can conjure up beings of their chosen element, called
elementals, and have them serve as pets for short periods of time.  They
also gain other powerful spells from their studies, and the effects of those
spells vary wildly from one element to another.

As stated above, there are four types of elementalists.  The evil races are
more akin to the destructive powers of fire and air.  The good races are more
akin to the powers of earth and water.  Each element has an opposite (air and
earth, fire and water) and there are spells that are based on this opposition.

Important Attributes: Intelligence
Races: Air --- Human, Orc, Rakshasa
       Earth - Human, Half-Elf, Orc
       Fire -- Human, Gnome, Drow Elf, Flind, Rakshasa
       Water - Human, Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Rakshasa

Equipment: Elementalists are spellcasters and are very limited in their use
           of weapons and armor.  They have an unsurpassed ability to use
           magical objects such as staves, wands, and scrolls.

Innate Abilities: None

0 ELEPHANTSTRENGTH~
Spell

Syntax:         cast 'elephantstrength' <target>
Area of Effect: Single target, Touch
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster
Type of spell:  Animal

This spell increases the target's strength and constitution, while slightly
decreasing the target's dexterity and agility.  Because of the spell's
detrimental effects, the target will save against it.  Thus, if the target
wants to be the recipient, he should "consent" the caster.

0 EQUIPMENT EQ~
Syntax: equipment

EQUIPMENT or EQ will allow you to view everything you are wearing or
carrying in your hands and the locations where they are.  For example:

<worn on head>      a crown of jewels
<wielded>           the black sword 'Doom of the Elders'
<worn on feet>      a pair of ugly leather sandals

~

0 'EQUIPMENT SLOTS'~
You can only wear or carry so much before you run out of room on your body
to place things and hands to hold things in.  You are limited to a number
of "slots", where things can be equipped.  The following is a list of
available equipment slots for most races:

Head, eyes, ear (x2), neck (x2), face, on body, about body, on back, on arms,
on hands, on finger (x2), on wrist (x2), on legs, on feet, attached to
belt (x3), held/wielded/used as shield (x2).

*Centaurs have a unique body shape and may wear certain equipment on the tail
and on the horses body. As these items are specifically made for Centaurs,
other race will not be able to wear them.*

Items can only be worn in certain slots.

Some weapons are two-handed, and require both two hands to wield for most
races (although some strong beings can carry two-handed weapons in one hand).

EXITS will tell you all the visible exits from the room you are in.  Not
all exits are visible, however.  Some are obscure and hidden, and must be

exits when you walk into a room.

Note that even if an exit is visible, other things could block passage,
such as walls, portals, and so on.

~

0 EXPERIENCE XP LEVELS EXP~
Experience points, or EXP, indicate how skillful and experienced you have
become.  You gain power by gaining levels.  Each level will give you
additional health points, and sometimes additional skills, spells, and
abilities.

You gain experience by doing the following:
     Killing a player (from the opposite side of the racewars) or a monster,
       or being in a group that kills a player or monster.
     Directly damaging a player or monster with an attack or spell.
     Healing a "tank" in your group.

You will gain additional experience for killing something that is a higher
level than yourself.  Killing things that are lower in level will result
in less experience.  Killing things while in a group will reduce the amount
of experience you gain, because it is split between group members (with higher
level characters receiving a larger share of the experience, to partially
prevent "power-leveling".

You will lose experience when you die.

-1 FLIND FLINDS~

Flind are evil, dog-faced humanoids, able to stand erect on two legs and with
hands able to manipulate as well as any human.  Smarter than gnolls, who are
similar in appearance to the flind, they are short, dirty, and usually
covered in red or brown fur.

The flind are a pack society, preferring to live in isolated flind
communities.  The head of the pack is usually the strongest warrior in the
community and serves until another defeats him in ritual combat.  Flind are
vicious and bloodthirsty, and flind raiding parties are common sights in many
of the more remote locations of civilization.  Flind prefer to attack those
weaker than themselves, and have a tendancy to flee from fair fights.

Class list: Warrior, Sorcerer, Cleric, Thief, Mercenary, Anti-Paladin,
            Fire Elementalist, Shaman

Stats:  Flind are more muscular and more intelligent than their gnoll
        cousins, which puts them about on an even level with humans.  Flinds
        make good spellcasters because of their intelligence, but the most
        flind choose to be more aggressive warrior classes.

overland map you may fly to very high levels, seeing a "bigger picture" of
the terrain around your position.  In certain zones, you can fly up and out
of them, appearing back on the overland map.  

You may also "fly land" to drop to the ground, landing safely there.  Flying

indicating other players and mobs that are on your own level or altitude.

GET will get an object.  If no container is specified, you will try to get
something from the room you are in.  GET ALL will attempt to grab everything
from the container or room.

TAKE is a synonym for GET.

GET, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a
player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if you had 2 swords in a backpack and wanted to get the second
one, you would type:

     get 2.sword backpack

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would
attempt to get an item with the keyword "2".

A container can be something in your inventory or the room you are in.
Corpses are considered containers for the purposes of using GET to loot
dead players or creatures.

-1 GITHYANKI GITHYANKIS~

A race of humanoids that were enslaved by the illithids for hundreds of
years, the githzerai and githyanki are both offshoots from the same
racial stock.  Physically almost identical to humans, although they are a
bit more thin, pale, and gaunt in appearance, the gith people "evolved"
under the yoke of the illithids.  They have pale yellow or red eyes
and pointed ears.

The githzerai and githyanki have fought a constant war of genocide against
one another since they split apart just after the rebellion against the
illithids.  Gith was a female slave that was chosen for special training
by the Overmind, the strange force that ruled over the illithid people.
The Overmind had decided that the illithids had become too lazy and were
no longer vibrant.  They gave Gith rebellious thought and the means to
unite her people against the illithids.

The vibrant nature of the humanoids in rebellion threatened to overwhelm
the Overmind and it split in two parts.  One half supported Gith, while
the other supported a powerful human mage named Zerthimon, who was her
confidant and lover.  The githyanki side were given powers of the mind,
allowing many of them to become great psionicists, much like their illithid
overseers.

To this day the githzerai and githyanki hate one another with a passion
that's unmatched.

Class list: Warrior, Sorcerer, Thief, Assassin, Psionicist, Anti-Paladin

Stats:  Githyanki are almost identical to humans in most physical and
        mental characteristics, although to suggest that fact to a githyanki
        would be likely to start a fight.

away from Gith, the female who lead the overall uprising.  He is now
revered as a god among his people, the githzerai, although the githzerai
king attempts to dispel this belief and make himself a diety.

Class list: Warrior, Anti-Paladin, Thief, Assassin

Stats:  Githzerai are almost identical to humans in most physical and mental

0 GIVE~

Syntax: give <amount> <coin type> <target>

GIVE will give an object to a target, either a mob or another player.

Giving a player or mob extremely heavy objects or large amounts of coins or
anything that would overload a player requires the target's consent.

GIVE, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a
player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if you had 2 spellbooks and wanted to give the second one to Ski,
you would type:

     give 2.spellbook Ski

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would

-1 GNOME GNOMES~

Gnomes are small humanoids, similar in stature to halflings, but more related
to the dwarven races than halflings.  Gnomes are intelligent and curious, and
have a fascination with all things mechanical and magical.  Gnomes are also
known to be a sturdy and dependable race.

Class list: Warrior, Sorcerer, Illusionist, Cleric, Fire Elementalist

Stats:  Gnomes have quick minds and above normal wisdom, and a quick and 
        dextrous body to match.  They lack strength, but are surprisingly 
        durable for their size.

-1 GOBLIN GOBLINS~

Goblins are a race of evil humanoids that are, typically, three to four
feet tall with green or yellowish skin and red eyes.  Goblins are usually
looked down upon by many of the other evil races because of their small
stature, despite the fact that goblin shamans are dangerous casters.

In the world of the Underdark, where surviving from day to day is difficult,
goblins are survivors.  Despite their small size, goblins can adapt to
their environments very easy and learn to fit in.  If more powerful races
threaten to overwhelm a goblin village, they either flee to live another day
or learn to make themselves invaluable to their conquerers.  Either way, the
main goal of a goblin is to live to see another day.

Class list: Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Thief

Stats:  Goblins tend to be weaker than most other races, but have a strange
        kind of wisdom that comes from being survivors.  Goblins are quick
        enough to roll with a punch, and fast enough to stick a dagger in
        the person doing the punching.

the leader.  After he has consent, the leader can group the other characters.
You must be in the same room as the group leader to be grouped.

To kick someone out of a group, a leader can type GROUP <player> again.  To

0 'GROUP RECALL'~

Area of Effect: Group, In-Room
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     N/A
Duration:       Instant
Type of spell:  Teleportation

This spell will attempt to recall the caster's entire party back to the
caster's home, just like the "Word of Recall" spell.  It will only work
on members that are in the same room as the caster.  However, this spell
is a little bit tricky.  Unlike other group spells which affect everyone
in the caster's party no matter what, this spell will only work on those
that are ABOVE the caster on the 'group' list.  Basically, the spell works
on each person in the group in the order they are listed on the 'group'
list, and when it gets to the caster, he is teleported home.  Since he is
no longer in the same location as the remaining members of the party, the
spell fails to send them home.

Basically, make sure the person that will be casting 'group recall' is
the last person grouped.

WARNING: If any of the people who are recalled are overloaded, there is a
chance that they will drop some equipment.

critical hits can still penetrate the magical field and do normal damage.

56 'GUILD CREATION' MAKECLAN~

To create a guild, you use the command
makeclan <clan_name>

This name should be something short and sweet, easy to remember.  It'll be
the filename, nothing more.  The who name is something different, and is set
after creation.  So if you're creating something like Disciples of Hate you
would use makeclan disciples, because you don't want to have to type a huge
long name whenever you want to stat, set, or play with the guild.

When you create a guild, the makeclan command tells you what you need to 
set next.  Generally you have to set the whoname, description, leader,
and a few other things.

To stat a clan you type
stat clan <clan_name>

Clan files are saved in the /clans directory, and are loaded by placing the 
clan name in the CLANS.LST file.  If for some reason you need a
clan not to load, just remove the name from the file.  This functions just 
like the AREA.LST file.

Guildhall Construction Rules and Notes

Last Modified: 1/21/99

This guide, written by Ski, should take you through the steps you need to
perform when writing a guildhall for Magma.  It is intended for use with
the DE program, which can be obtained from Github at:
https://github.com/Xangis/magma

This guide assumes you know how to use the DE program.  If you don't, you
shouldn't be making the guildhall.

This guide is broken down into numerous sections.  Type 'help construct1'
for the first section.
~

0 CONSTRUCT1~

1.  Contacting the admins
=========================
Before you start making the hall, you need to contact the Guildhall Admin.
This administrator will give you certain pieces of information you need
when making the zone.  He should give you the following pieces of
information:

1.  Starting vnum for rooms, objs, and mobs.
2.  Zone number
3.  Your association number
4.  A destination room number if you have a portal to a hometown.

You should tell the administrator where you would like the hall to go on the
map.  Guildhalls must be connected to one of the maps (either the overland
map or the underdark map), they must be reached by a "normal" exit (ie no
portals or teleports to the hall), the entrance to the hall must be at
ground level (no flying guildhalls), and they cannot be located within 5
"spaces" of another guildhall.  Goodie guilds cannot put halls in the
underdark, and evils cannot put halls on the main overland continent.

Continued in 'help construct2'
~

0 CONSTRUCT2~

2.  Creating the Guildhall
==========================
The second step is to make a brand new zone using the de program.  Easiest
way to do this is just to type:

de <hallname>  where <filename> should be something like "mowhall" (for the
               Masters of War guildhall).  
               
               Don't call the hall something generic like 'guild' or 'hall'.
               Make the name unique to your faction.
               
DE will bring up a few indicators letting you know it couldn't open any
files (since they don't exist yet).  It will then prompt you for the
starting vnum for rooms, objects, and mobs.  Enter the number that was
given to you by the Guildhall admin.

Enter a name for the zone when prompted.  Use something appropriate, such
as "Masters of War Guildhall".

Enter the zone number that was given to you by the Guildhall admin.  You
should now be in the DE program looking at the first room of the hall.

Continued in 'help construct3'
~

0 CONSTRUCT3~

3.  Editting the zone flags
===========================
Type "edit zone".
The zone name and number should be correct, since you entered them when
  you first created the zone.
Type "C" to edit lifespan values and reset mode.
Type "C" again to edit the reset mode.
Change the value to "0" so the zone never resets.
Type "D" to edit the miscellaneous bits.
The zone should have the "D. No Teleport" bit set.  Nothing else should be
  selected.

Continued in 'help construct4'
~

0 CONSTRUCT4~

4.  Laying out the golem room
=============================
The first room in the guildhall must be the golem room, and it must be
the room that will connect to the map.  This first room can have two
exits: one to the map and one into the hall.  The exit to the map can
be of any direction, but the exit into the hall cannot be a diagonal.

Edit the room and create an exit in the direction that you want to lead
to the map.  Link it to room -1.  The Guildhall admin will link the hall
to the map using this exit, once the guild is approved.

Continued in 'help construct5'
~

0 CONSTRUCT5~

5.  Rules for Rooms
===================
Each room should follow these rules:

Rooms must have an appropriate name and a room description.

The following flags should be chosen.  Make sure nothing else is selected.

     D. Indoors
     G. No Recall
     M. No Precipitation
     P. No Teleport
     X. No Summon
     Y. Guild Room
     Z. Twilight
     2. No gate/planeshift

The "R. Heal" flag may be chosen, but this adds to the cost of the guildhall.

You may only have one healing room per hall.  See the Prices section of
this document to see how much a healing room costs.

The room should have sector type "B. City".

Rooms (except the golem) room can have any number of exits.  Exits may not
have any doors.  Exits must be "reversible", which means if you go east
from one room to get to another, you can go west to get back to the first
room.

Rooms should have a fall percentage chance of 0%, a mana flag of 0, mana
value of 0, current strength of 0, and current direction of 0 (all the
default values).

Continued in 'help construct6'
~

0 CONSTRUCT6~

6. Rules for Golems
===================
Each hall can have up to 4 golems.  Golems must have an appropriate short
name, long name, keywords, and description.  These should correspond to
one another in a logical fashion.  For example, a golem could have:

Short name: 
"&+ga&n &+Gglowing&n &+ggreen&n &+Ggolem&n"
Long name: 
"&+gA golem made of&n &+Gglowing&n &+ggreen stone blocks passage to north.&n"
Keywords:
green golem glowing _guildgolem_ assoc1_n_0 _nomoney_ 
Description: 
&+gA powerful magic has enchanted this solid block of green stone, creating a
powerful guardian that blocks passage to the north.  Occassionally, brilliant
pulses of bright green flash through the substance that makes up this golem,
like blood through veins.

Mobs must have the following keywords:
     golem
     _guildgolem_
     assoc1_N_0 (see below for details)
     _nomoney_

You may not use other keywords to affect the golems, such as _size_ flags.

The assoc1_N_0 keyword varies from hall to hall.  The "1" should be
replaced with your association number, given to you by the Guildhall
admin.  The "N" should be replaced with the exit direction that leads
further into the hall.  The "0" should be left alone.

So, for a guild with association number 4, and an exit leading east into
the hall, each golem would have the keyword:

assoc4_E_0

Remember, you may not have diagonal exits leading further into the hall.

Golems should have the following E. action flags:
     "B. Sentinel"
     "D. Is NPC"
     "G. Stays in zone"
     "L. Memory"
     "M. Can't be paralyzed"
     "N. Can't be summoned"
     "O. Can't be bashed"
     "Z. Breaks charm"
     "1. Protector"

Golems should have the following F. affect1 flags:
     "D. Detect Invis"

Golems should not have any affect2, affect3, or affect4 flags.  Anything
else that golems need is handled by the code.

Golems should be species: "OG (golem)".
Golems should have a hometown of "0 (none)".
Golems should have an alignment of "0".
Golems may only have a class of "1. Warrior", "6. Cleric", or "10.
Sorcerer".

Golems should be level 59.
Golems should have a position and default position of "8 (standing)".
Golems may be neuter, male, or female.

All values in the "M." section of the mob editor should be left at the
default values of 0.

Golems cannot have quest or shop information.

All golems must be placed in the first room of the guildhall.  Golems may
not have equipment.  Golems cannot follow one another.

Continued in 'help construct7'
~

0 CONSTRUCT7~
     
Rules for Shopkeepers
=====================
A guild can have one shop and shopkeeper.

Shopkeepers should have an appropriate short name, long name, keywords,
and description.  These should correspond to each other in a logical
fashion.

Shopkeepers should have the following E. action flags:
     B. Sentinel
     D. Is NPC
     G. Stays in Zone
     L. Memory

Shopkeepers can have no affect1/affect2/affect3/affect4 flags.

Shopkeepers must have a race of "H. (humanoid)".
Shopkeepers should have a hometown of "0 (none)".
Shopkeepers should have an alignment of "0".
Shopkeepers should have a class of "0 (none)".

Shopkeepers should have a level of "1".
Shopkeepers should have a position and default position of "8 (standing)".
Shopkeepers can be neuter, male, or female.

Section M. values should be left as the default values of 0.

Shopkeepers cannot have quest information.

Shopkeepers should have the following shop information:

A. List of Items the Shop Sells
     
     custom food vnum
     custom badge vnum

     * designates optional equipment
     
Note: Just add the above items to the shopkeeper.  It will state "object

Costs
=====

Submission Fee:                 500
A basic hall:                   7,000
Golem:                          4,500
Additional room:                1,000
Inn:                              750
Fountain:                         500
Holy/Unholy Fountain:           1,750
Shop                            2,000
Healing room:                   3,500
Teleporter:                    10,000 (first)
                               50,000 (second)

Payment must be made in platinum on the same day the guildhall is added
to the map.  It must be made by hand by one of the guild leaders.  

A submission fee must be paid each time a guildhall is sent in.  This
means if you send in a hall, decide you need to change something, you will
be fined an additional 500 platinum.

The inn, shop, and healing rooms are NOT additional rooms.  They must be
placed in existing rooms.  So, for example, you can't buy a basic
guildhall, an inn, a shop, and a healing room and have 8 rooms.  You would
buy the basic hall 3 rooms if you wanted 8 rooms total.  You can place the
inn, shop, and healing room in those 5 basic rooms, however.

Bulliten boards are free.

Teleporters allow instantaneous transportation from a guild hall to a
'friendly' city's inn.  Teleporters are one-way from the guild hall to
the inn.

When purchasing a teleporter for a guild hall, you must choose the
'friendly' city destination.  Friendly cities are those which are the
hometowns of a race on your side of the racewars.  So, a goodie guild
could install a teleporter that leads to the inn in Paranel, or an evil
guild could install a teleporter to the Bloodrock inn.

The guild's first teleporter costs 10,000 platinum.  The second costs
50,000 platinum.  No guild can have more than 2 teleporters.  The two
teleporters do not have to have the same destination.

NOTE: The costs are for the guild as a whole, not per guildhall.  So if
you had two guildhalls, and wanted a teleporter in each one, the cost
would be 60,000 platinum for both teleporters, and you would use up your
maximum of 2 teleporters.

Once added, teleporters are permanent.  They cannot be removed and the
destination cannot be changed.

Stables are not allowed.

Guild chests are buggy currrently, and cannot be purchased.

You may NOT modify an existing guild.  You can replace it (at full costs),
but you will get no credit for the existing hall.

Information you must submit when you send the guildhall in:
===========================================================
Location on the map where you want it linked.
Detailed breakdown of costs.
Room vnum of the inn.  You don't have to do anything in DE to create the inn.
The inn is part of the mud code, and is added by the Guildhall admin.
Mob vnums of the golems.
Room vnum where the guild bulliten board should be located.

-1 HALF-ELF 'HALF ELF' HALF-ELVES 'HALF ELVES'~

Half-elves are a combination of human and elven parents, and this mixed
breeding usually causes them to be shunned by both sides.  Usually humans
and elves cannot have children, but in a few cases a normal birth occurs,
often at the cost of the mother's life.  This sad way to enter the world
is just the start of what is usually a tough and unfair life for a half-elf.

Half-elves usually come in two types: those who try to fit in with "normal"
society, and those with a chip on their shoulders who dare anyone to look down
upon them because of their heritage.

Half-elves have a mixture of human and elven physical traits, being somewhat
stronger and healthier than grey elves, but less so than a human.

Class list: Warrior, Sorcerer, Cleric, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary, Ranger,
            Earth Elementalist, Water Elementalist, Druid

Stats:  Half-elves tend to be slightly weaker and frailer than humans, but
        are quicker and smarter than their related kin.  

        STR: Below Average              INT: Average

-1 HALFLING HALFLINGS~

Halflings are a small humanoid race, blessed with amazing quickness and
dexterity but hampered by their lack of size.  Jovial and carefree by nature,
halflings stand roughly half the size of a human (hence the name), and
usually possess curly brown or dark hair, a light tan complexion, and a
stout or heavy frame caused by the halfling tendancy to indulge in good
food and spirits.

Halflings make excellent thieves because of their impressive quickness, but
this has caused many people to shun or outcast the entire race.  "All
halflings are thieves, it's just some do it more often" is a popular saying.

Class list: Warrior, Sorcerer, Thief, Cleric

Stats:  Nimble and quick, halflings are quick on their feet and just as fast
        with their hands.  Weaker than humans, they aren't overly intelligent
        or wise either.

        STR: Below Average              INT: Below Average

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~

staves, and the like.

WEAR is used for armor and clothing, and if there is no location specified,
the item will attempt to be worn on the first available slot that the object
can be worn on.  If an object can be worn in multiple possible inventory
slots (like a ring that can be worn on your ear and on your finger), you
can specify which inventory slot should be used.  WEAR ALL will attempt to
wear everything that is currently in your inventory.

WIELD is used for weapons.

REMOVE will take any object you are holding, wearing, or wielding and put 
it back in your inventory.  REMOVE ALL will attempt to remove everything you
have equipped and move it into your inventory.  You can only hold so much in
your inventory at one time.

These commands, as well as most object manipulation commands, allow the
use of the #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This
allows a player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the
same keywords.

For example, if you had 2 spellbooks and wanted to hold the second one, you
would type:

     hold 2.spellbook

-1 HUMAN~

The human race is younger than most of the other races of good alignment,
but already they have become one of the most powerful and numerous.  Humans
have been blessed (or cursed) with an amazing curiousity and desire to
expand and conquer.  Humans are very adept at living in a wide range of 
conditions and can be found almost anywhere.

Humans are more tolerant of other races and more open-minded about their
views of the world.  They're also one of the more warlike of the good
aligned races and conflicts between humans and elves, dwarves, and
other humans are common.  Because of this, some of the older races view
the humans as untrustworthy and hot-headed.

Class list: Warrior, Sorcerer, Cleric, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary, Paladin,
            Ranger, Earth Elementalist, Air Elementalist, Fire Elementalist,
            Water Elementalist, Druid, Illusionist

~

-1 ILLUSIONIST~

Masters of deception, Illusionists conjure phantasms in order to distort
perception.  The Illusionst relies on non-existance to sway beliefs and
common sense of those who view the magical illusion.  What is reality?
Entities that lack intelligence are much more susceptible to the magical
effects of an Illusion.  Creatures like Ogres and Centaurs will undoubtably
lack the cognizance to see an Illusion for what it is.

Illusionsts are also able to cast other sorts of magical spells since the
Illusionist is also a practicitioner of Magic.  Yet, the Illusionist uses
non-illusion spells to augment their own spells.

Very powerful Illusionists are capable of mixing illusion with reality to
provide an effect that does possess real aspects.  These powerful spells are
also capable of drawing creatures from the Plane of Shadow for short periods
of time.  These Shadow creatures can cause devestating results to the person
who is their chosen victim.  The culmination of reality with illusion gives
powerful Illusionists a vast arsenal.

Important Attributes: Intelligence

Races: Human, Gnome, Rakshasa

Equipment: Illusionists are spellcasters and are very limited in their use
           of weapons and armor.  They have an unsurpassed ability to use
           magical objects such as staves, wands, and scrolls.


Innate Abilities: None

0 LANGUAGES~

Each race has it's own language.  Most players can speak their native
language perfectly, but also start with a small amount of proficiency
in speaking and understanding languages of other races.  

If you do not have a high level of understanding of a language, when it
is spoken it will seem garbled or difficult to comprehend, or if you
attempt to speak it your own words will be garbled to anyone who hears you.

By being in contact with people who speak a language, you gain understanding
gradually as you listen.

sometimes providing vital clues to the player.

0 LUCK~
Attribute

Luck is difficult to describe.  Some people are just born lucky.  It may be
caused by some cosmic karmic balance, or the gods taking a special interest
in a person, or some natural innate ability to influence fate.  Luck can have
strange effects on the game, but it isn't a prime attribute for any class.
Needless to say, however, all classes can benefit from high luck scores.

-1 MERCENARY~
Fighter sub-class

The mercenary is a blend of fighter and rogue, having some of the skills of
each.  While he can't match the warrior in fighting skills nor the assassin
in backstabbing abilities, the skills that the mercenary possess combine some
of the best from both worlds.

Mercenaries are soldiers for hire, bounty hunters, pirates, and smugglers.
They have the unique ability to try and capture a foe, and at high levels of
experience they learn how to crush the throat of a spellcaster.  Mercenaries
also have the headbutt skill, which they can use and attempt to knock out or
daze an opponent.

Important Attributes: Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Constitution

Races: Barbarian, Mountain Dwarf, Half-elf, Orc, Duergar Dwarf, Troll, Ogre
       Flind, Minotaur, Human

Equipment: Mercenaries are a fighter-rogue hybrid.  They can use most
           weapons.  Their choice of armor is extensive, but still somewhat
           limited when compared to a warrior.

Innate Abilities: None

the arts of shamanism, but most prefer to pursue the simpler life of a
warrior.

races, and are known to build huge warbands that invade and pillage the lands

some link between the two species, although what that link may be has been
lost in time.

            Cleric, Shaman, Air Elementalist, Earth Elementalist

-1 PALADIN PALADINS~
Fighter sub-class

Paladins are holy warriors, people who fight for their gods and attempt to
bring good to the world.  Paladins are given some limited spellcasting
abilities by their gods, but only as long as they strive to destroy what
is evil and vile in the world.  Paladins are experts with two-handed weapons,
gaining bonuses to hit as they go up in level.  In addition, paladins have a
much higher chance of successfully bashing an opponent without using a
shield.

Paladins can detect evil and have the ability to summon a mount when the need
arises.  Paladins can also layhands, channelling the healing power of their
god onto themselves or another person.

Paladins cannot group with anti-paladins, and most likely would attack such
an evil creature on sight.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Wisdom

Races: Human, Dwarf

Equipment: Paladins can use almost all weapons and armor.  They arel imited
           in the types of magical items such as wands, staves, or scrolls.

Innate Abilities: Layhands, Detect Evil, Summon Mount (at level 10),
                  Protection from Evil

Paladins, because of their religious nature, may NOT toggle vicious to on.
They cannot toggle AGGR on either.  Paladins can also LOSE experience from
attacking good-aligned creatures.  The following chart gives you an idea of
how experience is calculated for paladins:

Victim is evil or neutral with alignment less than 0:
     Full experience as normal
Victim is neutral with alignment equal to or more than zero and aggressive:
     Gain 1/5th normal experience
Victim is neutral with alignment equal to or more than zero and
 not aggressive:
     Lose 1/5th normal experience
Victim is good and aggressive:
     Gain 1/50th normal experience
Victim is good and non-aggressive:
     Lose experience equal to the normal amount

0 PET PETS~
Pets are creatures who follow a player, taking orders and performing some
basic tasks.  Pets can be purchased in stores, summoned from spells (such
as elementals or a necromancer's undead followers), or obtained via other
means.

Most mobs consider the owner of the pet to be responsible for the pet's
actions.  If the pet attacks, the mob will most likely come after the owner
of the pet if the pet is killed.  Towns with justice systems may arrest pet
owners if the pet breaks any laws.

Pets are commanded using the ORDER command.

Some pets gradually tire of taking orders and cease to follow their masters.

You cannot rent with pets.  Once you have rented, your pets will forget all
about you and you must obtain new ones.

get a frag.  A person is not fraggable until they are above level 20.

0 PLANE PLANES~

From the journals of Lord Gorinae, the Planeswalker...

There are many planes of existance on which the creatures of the multi-verse
live.  Many know only of the "True Prime", the land of Magma itself.
Some narrowminded people think of this as our planet alone, but this is not
necessarily true.  The sun, other planetary systems, the stars... all reside
in the True Prime.

The other planes are completely different realms of existence.  They do not
touch our True Prime except by magical means.  These different planes are
accessible through many different spells such as 'plane shift', 'gate', and
the like.  Some creatures seem to have an innate ability to shift themselves
from one plane to another.  

To visualize the layout of the major planes of existence, think of the Astral
as a large diamond or sphere.  Along the equator of this sphere are the
Elemental Planes, spaced out equally.  The "opposing" elements are across
from one another (earth to air, fire to water).  Between these Elemental
Planes are the Paraelemental Planes, where two Elemental Planes intersect.

At the top of this sphere, there's the Positive Elemental Plane, and it's
opposite the Negative resides at the bottom.

Then, to top it all off, each of the Elemental Planes interacts with the
Positive and Negative, just as they interact with each other.  This creates
the Quasielemental Planes.

In theory, there could be an infinite amount of Elemental-related planes,
each caused by the lack of true "borders" between each of them.  The
Paraelemental Planes should interact with the Positive and Negative, and so
on.  This theory hasn't been proven by any explorers that I am familar with.

The Ethereal seems to exist everywhere and nowhere.  It's the realm of the
Demi-Planes, islands of matter in the Deep Ethereal that act much like the
True Prime in many cases.  Notable examples of this phenomenon are the
Demi-Plane of Dreams, the Demi-Plane of Shadows, and the Demi-Plane of Dread.  

Planes that are most commonly known are:

Astral - a dull silver expanse that seems to serve as a nexus for portals to
         other planes. 
Ethereal - another misty realm, though this one is full of color.  Split up
           into the Border Ethereal and the Deep Ethereal.

The Elemental Planes (sometimes called the Inner Planes) - these are the
places where the elementalist mages draw their power.

               Fire        Water       Earth       Air

The Positive and Negative Energy Planes - places of almost pure energy
of lack thereof.  The Positive is a place of radiance, where the
power can burn out a traveler in an instant.  The Negative is the
opposite, a place of cold and void, where the spirit is sucked from
the soul.

The Paraelemental Planes - where two adjacent Elemental planes touch.
        Magma (Fire + Earth)                  Smoke (Fire + Air)
        Ooze (Earth + Water)                  Ice (Air + Water)

The Quasielemental Planes - where a Elemental Plane touches the
Positive and Negative.
        Lightning (Air + Positive)            Vacuum (Air + Negative)            
        Mineral (Earth + Positive)            Dust (Earth + Negative)
        Steam (Water + Positive)              Salt (Water + Negative)
        Radiance (Fire + Positive)            Ash (Fire + Negative)

The True Prime may be dangerous to some, but these other planes of
existance are very deadly and should only be attempted by those of great
skill and mental fortitude.

-1 PSIONICIST~

Psionicists are a class that has amazing control over their minds, allowing
them to master the hidden power of the mind itself.  Psionicists use this
internal power to advance their causes, whatever those may be.  Psionicists
use the 'will' command to focus their energies, much like a magic-user does
while casting.

Psionicists don't require a spellbook, however.  When they gain levels, they
automatically gain the power and ability to cast new spells.  The spells a
psionicist learns cover a wide variety of abilities.

Psionicists use mana to cast spells.  They can continue to cast spells until
their reserve of mana is exhausted.  At that point, they must rest and
regenerate mana before they can cast spells again.

Important Attributes: Intelligence, Wisdom

Races: Githyanki

Equipment: Psionicists are spellcasters and are very limited in their
           use of weapons and armor.  They have an unsurpassed ability
           to use magical objects such as staves, wands, and scrolls.

Innate Abilities: None

0 PUT~
Syntax: put <object|all> <container>
Syntax: put <amount> <coin type> <container>

Some containers have a maximum amount of weight or internal room and will

PUT, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a
player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if you had 3 spellbooks and wanted to put them all in a backpack,
you would type:

     put all.spellbook backpack

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would attempt
to put everything you had in your inventory into your spellbook.

resurrected has low constitution, the strain of being resurrected
may be too great, in which case the spell may fail, and the corpse

~

-1 RITUALS~

Rituals are a special form of magic, practiced only by druids.  Certain
spells require more power than a single caster can produce.  Multiple
druids, working in concert with one another, can call upon the spirit
of the natural world to do their bidding, producing more powerful effects
than a lone druid could manage.

Most rituals have long casting times, but make up for that hindrance with
longer durations and better effects.

Rituals will have a minimum number of druids that must be involved to cast
the spell.  The druids must be of a certain level.  If more druids of the
appropriate level assist in the casting of the ritual, the spell will
take effect sooner.
~

-1 SAURIAL SAURIALS~

Saurials are a race of lizardmen who make their homes deep in large,
exotic jungle cities.  A race that prefers to stay isolated and keep
outsiders away, the saurials are extremely loyal to one another and
the sprawling temple-cities they inhabit.

Saurials are larger and more bulkier than humans.  Because of their
cold-blooded nature, they can be a bit lethargic at times and dislike
inclimate weather, preferring heated and wet environments such as
tropical rain forests.  

Class list: 

Stats:  The saurials are a bit larger and stronger than humans, but
        also seem slightly slower of wit.  The saurials also seem
        slightly slower than humans, but they can still strike with
        all the swiftness of a jungle viper if need be.

0 SCRIBE~

0 SELL~
Syntax: sell <object> <shopkeeper>

SELL will allow you to try and sell an item to a shopkeeper.  If no
shopkeeper is given, the first shopkeeper in the room will be chosen.

SELL, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a
player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same
keywords.

For example, if the command "LIST DAGGER" showed you that a shopkeeper had
five daggers, you could type "BUY 3.DAGGER".

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would
attempt to buy three daggers, not the third dagger.

Prices in shops can be affected by a player's charisma.

totems to focus their powers into terrific magical effects.  Unlike druids,

harness and twist the forces of nature into doing their bidding, rather than
asking politely as would a druid.

~

0 SIZES SIZE~

Every creature on Magma has a size classification.  This size is used
for certain skills, such as bash and springleap.  These skills have
restrictions on the sizes of creatures they can be used on relative to
the size of the player issuing the command.

For example, a player can only bash a creature that is his own size, up
to two sizes larger, or down to two sizes smaller.

In addition to the restrictions, there may be penalties for attempting
to use skills on races that aren't the same size as you.  You can bash
something two size classes smaller, but you'll have a harder time doing
it.

+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Size           | Example Races                                             |
+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| tiny           | worms, rats, bats                                         |
| small          | halfling, gnome, goblin                                   | 
| small-medium   | grey elf, drow elf, mountain dwarf, duergar dwarf         | 
| medium         | human, rakshasa, half-elf, flind, orc, githyanki,         |
|                | githzerai, thri-kreen, aquatic elf                        |
| medium-large   | barbarian, minotaur                                       |
| large          | centaur, troll                                            |
| huge           | ogre                                                      |
| giant          | giant                                                     |
| titanic        | hydra                                                     |
| gargantuan     | dragon, devil                                             |
+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Please keep in mind the sizes are not simply based on how tall or heavy a
race is.  Other factors such as the strength and physique of the creature
play a part in what size a creature is.  

However, and we can't stress this enough, one of the most important factors
we used was game balance, especially where racewars are considered.  Let's
look at an example:

The ogre is arguably the best warrior class for players on the evil side
of the racewars.  As a huge creature, it can only bash down to medium-large
level, which means it can bash centaurs and barbarians for the most part.
Even reduced, the ogre can only bash medium, which still means most of the
goodie caster races are immune.

This means that race/class combinations that weren't used on Basternae 1
as much are more valuable on Magma.  A duergar warrior, for example,
would have no troubles bashing most of the goodie caster races.  Human and
orc paladins/anti-paladins may not be able to do the damage of the warriors
of a bigger race, but they can keep casters on the ground easier.  It's a
trade-off.

Also notice that some mobs can be larger or smaller than an "average"
creature of that race.  The "enlarge" and "reduce" spells also can affect
a creature's size.

-1 SORCERER~

Sorcerers are spellcasters who have focused their lives on gaining power
from the magical forces that surround them.  They wield incredible offensive
power with their magic, but their physical abilities are lacking.  Sorcerers,
like all magic-users, must rely on spellbooks to contain their accumulated
knowledge.  The spellbook is used when memorizing the spell, but once it has
been cast, the knowledge of its casting disappears from the sorcerer's
memory. 

Important Attributes: Intelligence

Races:  Drow Elf, Grey Elf, Flind, Githyanki, Half-Elf, Halfling, Human,
        Gnome, Orc, Rakshasa

Equipment: Sorcerers are spellcasters and are very limited in their use of 
           weapons and armor.  They have an unsurpassed ability to use
           magical objects such as staves, wands, and scrolls.

Innate Abilities: None

~

-1 STORY~
The story of the world of Magma is a simple one, but that makes it no
less tragic.

The world is shattered, effectively split in two between the surface world
and that of the Underdark, a massive collections of caves and tunnels that
runs underground.  On the surface, the "good" aligned races make their homes,
while the "evil" races either choose or are forced to live in the dangerous
Underdark.

For all of recorded history, the good and evil races have been at war.
Armies march forward to combat, one side wins and slays the other, then is
destroyed itself by another army.  It is a vicious cycle of warfare and
neither side seems inclined to put a stop to it.  The "good" races talk of
peace, but it's a peace that would cost the lives of all unclean or unpure
races of the dark.  The evil races know only war, trained from birth to live
in hostile environments.  Horrible creatures make their homes in the
Underdark, more than willing to kill any victims for food or sport, but it's
just as likely a young evil will find himself dead from the knife of one of
his kin.

It's the world of Magma, where reflexes and fighting skills are
constantly honed to perfection, where adventure waits around every corner,
and death can lurk behind even the most friendly of faces.  It's a world of
combat and destruction, where fame and forture go to the aggressive and the
meek get stomped into the ground.

Welcome home.  Welcome to Magma.

0 THAC0 THACO~
THAC0 stands for "to-hit armor class zero".  It's a number that represents
how much chance you have to hit a character or person with an armor class
equal to zero (the mid-point between +100 AC and -100 AC).

The lower your THAC0, the better chance you have of hitting.

or hinder your ability to hit your opponent.

-1 THIEF~
Rogue sub-class

Thieves are rogues, stealing and killing to make a living.  They're the
masters of picking locks, finding traps, and stealing from friend and foe
alike.  Thieves prefer to skulk in the shadows during combat, waiting for
the opportunity to stab someone in the back.  They have some abilities that
allow them to fight head-to-head, but against a properly trained and equipped
warrior, they probably don't stand a chance.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility

Races: Human, Grey Elf, Halfling, Mountain Dwarf, Half-Elf, Githzerai, Orc
       Duergar, Githyanki, Flind, Rakshasa

Equipment: Thieves are rogues, and can use most weapons.  Their choice of
           armor is more limited, however, since heavy armor makes sneaking
           in shadows impossible.

Innate Abilities: None

0 THIRST THIRSTY~

The need for water is not something you can ignore.  Thirst is much like
hunger in that it needs to be satisfied.  If you neglect to drink water
you will start to lose hps and regenerate movement and hitpoints more
slowly.

Thirst for casters can be very harsh because you cannot memorize, pray
or cast spells with a parched throat.  

Make sure to drink.  There are many fountains throughout the game where
free water is offered.

56 USERS~

you have.  If no shopkeeper is given, the first shopkeeper in the room will
be chosen.

VALUE, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a
player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if the command "LIST DAGGER" showed you that a shopkeeper had
five daggers, you could type "BUY 3.DAGGER".

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would
attempt to buy three daggers, not the third dagger.

Prices in shops can be affected by a player's charisma.

0 WAIT 'WAIT STATES'~
Wait states is a mechanism in which we count the delay between your actions.
Commands such like casting, kicking, walking, disarming, brandishing, zapping,
quaffing, etc cause a certain delay before your next action can go through.
This represents the amount of time you need in order to complete the action.

You may also accumulate a delay when a certain action is performed upon you.
These actions are being tripped, disarmed, etc.

If you are in combat, it is wise to use your wait state level as an indicator
as to when your next command will go through.  Should you have a wait state
greater than 0, all your other typed commands will be queued until your wait
returns to 0.

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy [number]

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy and will flee during combat if they are hurt.

0 WISDOM~
Attribute

Wisdom is a measure of many things: judgement, enlightenment, willpower,
and intuition.  It represents the planning ability of a character and his
ability to learn from experience.  It is the primary attribute of all
priestly classes and is a benefit to all other classes as well, since it
impacts the speed at which one can learn.

Some races naturally are more wise than others.  The mountain dwarves and
their duergar enemies are counted as some of the wisests of the races,
because of their long lifespan and the methods by which they hand down
information from generation to generation.  Ogres and barbarians are
considered to be the most unwise.
