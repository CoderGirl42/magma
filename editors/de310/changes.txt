Changes between 3.09 and 3.10:
------------------------------
    Added a bunch of new weapon types.

Changes between 3.08 and 3.09:
------------------------------
    Added the Neogi race.
    Included the keywords.txt file in the archive, which explains advanced
      keyword use on mobs.
    Updated the Generic_Vnums file.  It is now version 2.
    Updated the DikuEdit documentation and sorted files into directories.
    Added "(ignored)" to any spells on the spell list if they are either
      not processed or not understood by the MUD.  You can still set the
      value, after all it might be made to work someday, but it's nice to
      know whether something will work before you create it.
    Added "required room #" field for switches.  If set, this means that the
      switch will only work when in that room vnum.
    Added Chronomancer and Illusionist spells (and a few misc. others).
    Changed some of the internal routines.  This may help those of you that
      have reported odd screen/text glitches.
    Added the mud-wide object limit field to objects.  Please do not set this,
      as it's something the immortals will handle.  It controls the number of
      object that may exist in the mud on all players and will limit the
      instances of an object circulating to a specific number.  Note that an
      instance of the object MUST be loaded into the zone for this number
      to save.

Changes between 3.07 and 3.08:
------------------------------
    Made the anti-whatever bits check mob's class properly for equipping.

Changes between 3.06 and 3.07:
------------------------------
    Changed save vs. rod to save vs. poison.
    Changed save vs. petrification to save vs. disease.
    Added new quest "receive item" types:
      6 = Transfer all mobs from room <vnum>
      7 = Create mob <vnum>
      8 = Create mob <vnum> as player's pet
      9 = Transfer player to room <vnum>
      10 = Transfer player's group to room <vnum>

Changes between 3.05 and 3.06:

      number field on basternae as extended terrain info for the worldmap.
    Added the norepair extra2 flag.
    Added the ability to actually set maximum # loaded for objects within
      the .obj file.

    Added summon item type.  Much like a teleport, but will summon mobs
      from a specified room based on a command trigger.
    No Camp flag added to rooms.
    Nice thief act flag on mobs is now Guardian.
    Ship room #1 and #2 flags added to keys, for internal use by the MUD.
    Ship/vehicle cargo capacity added.

Changes between 3.03 and 3.04:
------------------------------
    Lead material type added.
    Mob race Bear now has keywords BE - previously creating a bear would
      actually create an aboleth.
    The limit scan room bit is ignored by the mud.  It's been changed to
      unused in the editor to show this.

Changes between 3.02 and 3.03:
------------------------------

    Added more teleport trigger keywords
    Language setting for notes added.
    Object type book removed.  Use note instead.

    Shopkeeper racist information for the new races has been added.
    Jade material type added.
    Unused positions flying, levitating, and swimming have been removed
      due to the fact that that is determined by the bits, abilities, and
      terrain of the mob.  The illegal (sub-sleeping) positions have also
      been removed.

Changes between 3.00f and 3.01:

    Traps have more options for trigger types and also have a percent chance
      of going off settable.

Changes between 3.00e and 3.00f:
-------------------------------

    Added githzerai and rust monster races.
    Default shop strings for new shops more normal.  Old ones still goofy.
      The new shop messages use $N instead of %s for the player's name and
      use $t instead of %s for the cash amount.  Don't ask why, just go
      with the "It's a code thing".
    Added the hunter class.
    Added anti flags for minotaur and githzerai races
    Added no exp flag to mobs, to be used sparingly.

      Note that if you have flagged anything biofeedback or anti-good
      in a previous version you will have to reset those bits.
