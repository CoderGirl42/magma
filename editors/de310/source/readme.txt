README file for dikuEdit 3.10 Source

*** NOTE **********************************************************************
The only compiler that this has been tested with is DJGPP for Win32.  It should
work fine on other compilers, but you may have to create your own workspace in
something like Visual C++.  The included Visual Project solution is incredibly
broken (2,006 compile errors), but you're welcome to try fixing it if you're
brave/patient.
*******************************************************************************

This archive comes with a compiled version of DikuEdit. Look for de.exe in the
parent directory.

I offer no warranties.  If you can make this work, good for you.  If not, you
might as well find something else to do.

If you have DJGPP working right, you should only need to unzip the files and
type "make" in the root directory.

There is no documentation for this stuff.  You'll have to fiddle with it
until you understand it.
