These editors can generate file formats that work with Magma 3.04.


de310:  Contains a copy of DikuEdit 3.10 along with the source.  DikuEdit generates
        zones in a multi-file format that has to be run through the Makezone utility
        in /area/convzone in order to load into the MUD.

mzf3-32:  Contains a copy of the Envy version of MakeZonesFast32 along with the source.
          MZF generates areas in the envy .are format.
