This is a beta test of MZF32 for Windows '95 and Windows NT 3.5x.
It is 0.95beta.

This version doesn't need the 3 large .DLLs which came with the
alpha test version as I have relinked it.

Enhancments over MZF32 alpha
1) Does not lock up on NT when last line in file is #$ with no cr lf
2) Does not crash NT when error message exceeds 255 characters
3) Can take a filename argument, and can work as a file association for
   .are documents in the explorer/file manager
4) Keeps track of 5 most recent documents
5) Icons closer to Win'95 standard icons

Note for Windows NT users:
Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 users without newshell need to copy CTL3D32.DLL to
\winnt35\system32 directory and delete from mzf directory.

This version includes a zone I wrote which was the home city for a race
of bird people known as the Aarakocrans.  Feel free to use it if your mud
has racial cities and a race of Aarakocrans.
