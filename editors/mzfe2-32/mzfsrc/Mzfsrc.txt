MZF is a MUD editor for Merc and Envy format DikuMUDs.

This is the second public release of MZF source code.  It will probably
be the last, I haven't developed this in a long time.

MZF requires Borland C++ 4.x to compile.  It could be made to compile
with later versions of Borland C++ with a little work.  The code is kind
of crappy, I never intended it to become some big.  Borland C++ 4.01
sometimes gets upset by the large size of this program.

This version uses .INI files for customization of spells, etc.  This
technique worked ok in the 32 bit version, but it was slow as hell in
the 16 bit version so you probably won't want to build a 16 bit version.

This source version builds both 16 bit and 32 bit executables.  The 
Diku, Merc, and Envy licenses still apply.  Sorry, I would prefer a
licence like the GPL but I wanted to use the actual Merc/Envy parser
which meant Diku licence.
